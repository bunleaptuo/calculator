This project is an advanced scientific calculator built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Matplotlib for plotting graphs. It supports basic arithmetic operations, scientific functions like sin, cos, tan, square roots, logarithms, and exponentiation, along with memory operations (MC, MR, M+, M-). Users can also plot linear equations by entering the slope and y-intercept. The application includes error handling for invalid inputs and operations such as division by zero. It features a modern dark-themed interface, keyboard bindings for quick operations, and dependencies on Python 3.x, Matplotlib, and NumPy. To run the app, install Python and required libraries, then execute the Python script. The project is open-source and can be used for personal or educational purposes, with future enhancements possible for more advanced functions and graphing support.
